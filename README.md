# z2a_project
Submission for Zero To Asic course offered by @mattvenn.
The "submission" is a single "wrapped" project in Matt Venn's "multi-project wrapper" instantiated as a user-project in Caravel.
This particular wrapped project is a serial divider which Caravel's core (picorv32) can access via a memory mapped Wishbone peripheral.
